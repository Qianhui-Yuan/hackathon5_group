# Instructions

## Task I
* You will be working in groups on a quantified student project
* Download the Sensor Kinetics Pro app to your iOS or Android device (or similar gyroscope measuring app)
* Split into subgroups with each subgroup investigating one measures available in the app
* Each subgroup should report back after 20min with what they have learned

## Task II
* In consultation with your group select a physical activity that: a) can be measured using the app, b) has a concrete, sontinuous, countable outcome and c) some members of the group are experts and some are novices at - If you are looking for inspiration you can find previous student projects below.
* Collect measurements for all members of the group performing the task using the app
* Create a Github repo where you can store and share your data
* Using K-means, can you identify the novices from the experts using only the app data?
* Visualize your results using ggplot2

## Task III
* Devise five questions on a five point Likert scale that ask members of your group about their experience with your chosen task
* Collect data from all members of your group
* Run a PCA analysis on the data
* What does PC1 represent in your analysis?
* Visualize the PC1 results for each member of your group

## Task IV
* If you could only choose one thing to predict the score for each member of your group (raw data variable, a cluster or a PC) what would it be and why?
* Create a visualization that supports your conclusion
* Based on your conclusion devise an intervention that would help novice members of your group imporve their performance

## Task V
* Submit a link to your Github repo containing your data, code, visualizations and conclusions to charles.lang@tc.columbia.edu by 5pm EDT 12/14/20.
